Marker
========================================================


**************************
Abstract
**************************

A Marker is a node on a tree graph representing Async tasks, Contexts
and the internal vertexes connecting them. One of the major reasons
for using the abstraction of a Marker is that a node of the graph which
is an Async can replace itself with a Context which itself has children
Async tasks, thus enabling fan-out after the root Context has inserted
tasks into the task queue. Asyncs are always leaf nodes. Contexts can
be either a root node or an internal vertex.
